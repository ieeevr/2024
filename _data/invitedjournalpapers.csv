7,A Systematic Literature Review of Virtual Reality Locomotion Taxonomies,,,"The change of the user's viewpoint in an immersive virtual environment, called locomotion, is one of the key components in a virtual reality interface. Effects of locomotion, such as simulator sickness or disorientation, depend on the specific design of the locomotion method and can influence the task performance as well as the overall acceptance of the virtual reality system. Thus, it is important that a locomotion method achieves the intended effects. The complexity of this task has increased with the growing number of locomotion methods and design choices in recent years. Locomotion taxonomies are classification schemes that group multiple locomotion methods and can aid in the design and selection of locomotion methods. Like locomotion methods themselves, there exist multiple locomotion taxonomies, each with a different focus and, consequently, a different possible outcome. However, there is little research that focuses on locomotion taxonomies. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overview of possible locomotion taxonomies and analysis of possible decision criteria such as impact, common elements, and use cases for locomotion taxonomies. We aim to support future research on the design, choice, and evaluation of locomotion taxonomies and thereby support future research on virtual reality locomotion.","Lisa Marie Prinz; Tintu Mathew; Benjamin Weyers"
8,"Revisiting Walking-in-Place by Introducing Step-Height Control, Elastic Input, and Pseudo-Haptic Feedback",,,"Walking-in-place (WIP) is a locomotion technique that enables users to 'walk infinitely' through vast virtual environments using walking-like gestures within a limited physical space. This paper investigates alternative interaction schemes for WIP, addressing successively the control, input, and output of WIP. First, we introduce a novel height-based control to increase advanced speed. Second, we introduce a novel input system for WIP based on elastic and passive strips. Third, we introduce the use of pseudo-haptic feedback as a novel output for WIP meant to alter walking sensations. The results of a series of user studies show that height and frequency based control of WIP can facilitate higher virtual speed with greater efficacy and ease than in frequency-based WIP. Second, using an upward elastic input system can result in a stable virtual speed control, although excessively strong elastic forces may impact the usability and user experience. Finally, using a pseudo-haptic approach can improve the perceived realism of virtual slopes. Taken together, our results suggest that, for future VR applications, there is value in further research into the use of alternative interaction schemes for walking-in-place.","Yutaro Hirao; Takuji Narumi; Ferran Argelaguet; Anatole Lécuyer"
4,Intentional Head-Motion Assisted Locomotion for Reducing Cybersickness,,,"We present an efficient locomotion technique that can reduce cybersickness through aligning the visual and vestibular induced self-motion illusion. Our locomotion technique stimulates proprioception consistent with the visual sense by intentional head motion, which includes both the head's translational movement and yaw rotation. A locomotion event is triggered by the hand-held controller together with an intended physical head motion simultaneously. Based on our method, we further explore the connections between the level of cybersickness and the velocity of self motion through a series of experiments. We first conduct Experiment 1 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different translation velocities using our method and then conduct Experiment 2 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different angular velocities. Our user studies from these two experiments reveal a new finding on the correlation between translation/angular velocities and the level of cybersickness. The cybersickness is greatest at the lowest velocity using our method, and the statistical analysis also indicates a possible U-shaped relation between the translation/angular velocity and cybersickness degree. Finally, we conduct Experiment 3 to evaluate the performances of our method and other commonly-used locomotion approaches, i.e., joystick-based steering and teleportation. The results show that our method can significantly reduce cybersickness compared with the joystick-based steering and obtain a higher presence compared with the teleportation. These advantages demonstrate that our method can be an optional locomotion solution for immersive VR applications using commercially available HMD suites only.","Zehui Lin; Xiang Gu; Sheng Li; Zhiming Hu; Guoping Wang"
6,Mitigation of VR Sickness during Locomotion with a Motion-Based Dynamic Vision Modulator,,,"In virtual reality, VR sickness resulting from continuous locomotion via controllers or joysticks is still a significant problem. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms to mitigate VR sickness that dynamically modulate the user’s field of view by modifying the contrast of the periphery based on movement, color, and depth. In contrast with previous work, this vision modulator is a shader that is triggered by specific motions known to cause VR sickness, such as acceleration, strafing, and linear velocity. Moreover, the algorithm is governed by delta velocity, delta angle, and average color of the view. We ran two experiments with different washout periods to investigate the effectiveness of dynamic modulation on the symptoms of VR sickness, in which we compared this approach against baseline and pitch-black field-of-view restrictors. Our first experiment made use of a just-noticeable-sickness design, which can be useful for building experiments with a short washout period.","Guanghan Zhao; Jason Orlosky; Steven Feiner; Photchara Ratsamee; Yuki Uranishi"
9,The Effects of Spatial Complexity on Narrative Experience in Space-Adaptive AR Storytelling,,,"A critical yet unresolved challenge in designing space-adaptive narratives for Augmented Reality (AR) is to provide consistently immersive user experiences anywhere, regardless of physical features specific to a space. For this, we present a comprehensive analysis on a series of user studies investigating how the size, density, and layout of real indoor spaces affect users playing Fragments, a space-adaptive AR detective game. Based on the studies, we assert that moderate levels of traversability and visual complexity afforded in counteracting combinations of size and complexity are beneficial for narrative experience. To confirm our argument, we combined the experimental data of the studies (n=112) to compare how five different spatial complexity conditions impact narrative experience when applied to contrasting room sizes. Results show that whereas factors of narrative experience are rated significantly higher in relatively simple settings for a small space, they are less affected by complexity in a large space. Ultimately, we establish guidelines on the design and placement of space-adaptive augmentations in location-independent AR narratives to compensate for the lack or excess of affordances in various real spaces and enhance user experiences therein.","Jae-eun Shin;Boram Yoon;Dooyoung Kim;Woontack Woo"
10,Kine-Appendage: Enhancing Freehand VR Interaction Through Transformations of Virtual Appendages,,,"Kinesthetic feedback, the feeling of restriction or resistance when hands contact objects, is essential for natural freehand interaction in VR. However, inducing kinesthetic feedback using mechanical hardware can be cumbersome and hard to control in commodity VR systems. We propose the kine-appendage concept to compensate for the loss of kinesthetic feedback in virtual environments, i.e., a virtual appendage is added to the user's avatar hand; when the appendage contacts a virtual object, it exhibits transformations (rotation and deformation); when it disengages from the contact, it recovers its original appearance. A proof-of-concept kine-appendage technique, BrittleStylus , was designed to enhance isomorphic typing. Our empirical evaluations demonstrated that (i) BrittleStylus significantly reduced the uncorrected error rate of naive isomorphic typing from 6.53% to 1.92% without compromising the typing speed; (ii) BrittleStylus could induce the sense of kinesthetic feedback, the degree of which was parity with that induced by pseudo-haptic (+ visual cue) methods; and (iii) participants preferred BrittleStylus over pseudo-haptic (+ visual cue) methods because of not only good performance but also fluent hand movements.","Yang Tian;Hualong Bai;Shengdong Zhao;Chi-Wing Fu;Chun Yu;Haozhao Qin;Qiong Wang;Pheng-Ann Heng"
5,Role-Exchange Playing: An Exploration of Role-Playing Effects for Anti-Bullying in Immersive Virtual Environments,,,"Role-playing is widely used in many areas, such as psychotherapy and behavior change. However, few studies have explored the possible effects of playing multiple roles in a single role-playing process. We propose a new role-playing paradigm, called role-exchange playing, in which a user plays two opposite roles successively in the same simulated event for better cognitive enhancement. We designed an experiment with this novel role-exchange playing strategy in the immersive virtual environments; and school bullying was chosen as a scenario in this case. A total of 234 middle/high school students were enrolled in the mixed-design experiment. From the user study, we found that through role-exchange, students developed more morally correct opinions about bullying, as well as increased empathy and willingness to engage in supportive behavior. They also showed increased commitment to stopping bullying others. Our role-exchange paradigm could achieve a better effect than traditional role-playing methods in situations where participants have no prior experience associated with the roles they play. Therefore, using role-exchange playing in the immersive virtual environments to educate minors can help prevent them from bullying others in the real world. Our study indicates a positive significance in moral education of teenagers. Our role-exchange playing may have the potential to be extended to such applications as counseling, therapy, and crime prevention.","Xiang Gu;Sheng Li;Kangrui Yi;Xiaojuan Yang;Huiling Liu;Guoping Wang"
3,MD-Cave: An Immersive Visualization Workbench for Radiologists,,,"The MD-Cave is an immersive analytics system that provides enhanced stereoscopic visualizations to support visual diagnoses performed by radiologists. The system harnesses contemporary paradigms in immersive visualization and 3D interaction, which are better suited for investigating 3D volumetric data. We retain practicality through efficient utilization of desk space and comfort for radiologists in terms of frequent long duration use. MD-Cave is general and incorporates: (1) high resolution stereoscopic visualizations through a surround triple-monitor setup, (2) 3D interactions through head and hand tracking, (3) and a general framework that supports 3D visualization of deep-seated anatomical structures without the need for explicit segmentation algorithms. Such a general framework expands the utility of our system to many diagnostic scenarios. We have developed MD-Cave through close collaboration and feedback from two expert radiologists who evaluated the utility of MD-Cave and the 3D interactions in the context of radiological examinations. We also provide evaluation of MD-Cave through case studies performed by an expert radiologist and concrete examples on multiple real-world diagnostic scenarios, such as pancreatic cancer, shoulder-CT, and COVID-19 Chest CT examination.","Shreeraj Jadhav;Arie E.

2,Analysis of the Saliency of Color-Based Dichoptic Cues in Optical See-Through Augmented Reality,,,"In a future of pervasive augmented reality (AR), AR systems will need to be able to efficiently draw or guide the attention of the user to visual points of interest in their physical-virtual environment. Since AR imagery is overlaid on top of the user's view of their physical environment, these attention guidance techniques must not only compete with other virtual imagery, but also with distracting or attention-grabbing features in the user's physical environment. Because of the wide range of physical-virtual environments that pervasive AR users will find themselves in, it is difficult to design visual cues that “pop out” to the user without performing a visual analysis of the user's environment, and changing the appearance of the cue to stand out from its surroundings. In this paper, we present an initial investigation into the potential uses of dichoptic visual cues for optical see-through AR displays, specifically cues that involve having a difference in hue, saturation, or value between the user's eyes. These types of cues have been shown to be preattentively processed by the user when presented on other stereoscopic displays, and may also be an effective method of drawing user attention on optical see-through AR displays. We present two user studies: one that evaluates the saliency of dichoptic visual cues on optical see-through displays, and one that evaluates their subjective qualities. Our results suggest that hue-based dichoptic cues or “Forbidden Colors” may be particularly effective for these purposes, achieving significantly lower error rates in a pop out task compared to value-based and saturation-based cues.","Austin Erickson;Gerd Bruder;Gregory F.

1,Analyzing the Effect of Diverse Gaze and Head Direction on Facial Expression Recognition with Photo-Reflective Sensors Embedded in a Head-Mounted Display,,,"As one of the facial expression recognition techniques for Head-Mounted Display (HMD) users, embedded photo-reflective sensors have been used. In this paper, we investigate how gaze and face directions affect facial expression recognition using the embedded photo-reflective sensors. First, we collected a dataset of five facial expressions (Neutral, Happy, Angry, Sad, Surprised) while looking in diverse directions by moving 1) the eyes and 2) the head. Using the dataset, we analyzed the effect of gaze and face directions by constructing facial expression classifiers in five ways and evaluating the classification accuracy of each classifier. The results revealed that the single classifier that learned the data for all gaze points achieved the highest classification performance. Then, we investigated which facial part was affected by the gaze and face direction. The results showed that the gaze directions affected the upper facial parts, while the face directions affected the lower facial parts. In addition, by removing the bias of facial expression reproducibility, we investigated the pure effect of gaze and face directions in three conditions. The results showed that, in terms of gaze direction, building classifiers for each direction significantly improved the classification accuracy. However, in terms of face directions, there were slight differences between the classifier conditions. Our experimental results implied that multiple classifiers corresponding to multiple gaze and face directions improved facial expression recognition accuracy, but collecting the data of the vertical movement of gaze and face is a practical solution to improving facial expression recognition accuracy.","Fumihiko Nakamura;Masaaki Murakami;Katsuhiro Suzuki;Masaaki Fukuoka;Katsutoshi Masai;Maki Sugimoto"
