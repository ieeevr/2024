BOFSocialX4,Towards real-time evaluation of cyber-sickness in VR,"Cybersickness is an annoying issue in locomotion-dominated VR applications, while the online evaluation of cybersickness during the use of VR will benefit many developers and researchers. Currently, an approach to evaluating cybersickness is using subjective questionnaires (e.g., SSQ), but the questionnaire-based evaluation will interrupt the experiment and introduce huge individual variances. Can we develop some tools to report cybersickness in real-time according to physiological signals such as EDA, Heart rate, EEG, Posture sway, etc.?  Which feature can be extracted as the best online cybersickness indicator? Can artificial intelligence algorithms work? How can we validate its performance? If you have any ideas or are interested in this topic, come to join us! ",Yuyang Wang,"Tuesday, March 30th, 16:00-17:00 UTC+1"
