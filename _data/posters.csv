This pilot study investigates the feasibility and usability of delivering remote art therapy in a customised CVE. Four young adults as clients and two registered expressive arts therapists participated in the study. The quantitative and qualitative results suggested that the CVE-enabled approach was feasible and the system's usability was high. The approach was well received by both the clients and the therapists. Possible improvements to the CVE were identified and will be addressed in our future work.,,Session/Server 1,1

However, insufficient resolution of current consumer head-mounted displays leads to difficulties in capturing nuances of virtual teachers in VR, which may be solved by scaling up the heads of virtual teachers. In this paper, we explore the effects of design and environmental factors on the ideal head scales for recognizing the virtual teacher’s facial expressions. Our results show that the facial visualization style and the distance from the user to the virtual teacher are important factors affecting facial expression recognition, which could contribute to the design and optimization of educational VR.",,Session/Server 1,2

However, it generally needs dedicated 3D map generation, which is costly. Thus, some methods have tried to utilize 3D mesh maps instead. However, the significant visual difference between the query image of the camera to be localized and a 3D mesh map results in low accuracy. This paper proposes to improve accuracy by dynamically controlling the comparison threshold and selecting the best localization result in a recursive estimation process. The results show that it improves the accuracy by 15% compared to the baseline method.",,Session/Server 1,

Cybersickness susceptibility varies across individuals, and previous research reported that interpupillary distance (IPD) may be a factor. However, that work emphasized cybersickness recovery rather than cybersickness immediately after exposure. The current study (N=178) examined if the mismatch between the user's IPD and the VR headset's IPD setting contributes to immediate cybersickness.

A well-known ratio of attention, AR, was computed from recorded brainwaves of the participants during the task. Their CWL was derived from a de-facto questionnaire of the NASA task load index.  The study’s outcomes indicated that, while the role of the AR in the measurement remained unclear, the CWL could serve the measurement.",,Session/Server 1,22

For the Mel-Spectrogram modal, we design a Mel-Spectrogram encoder based on the Swin Transformer pre-trained model to extract the audio spectrum features hierarchically. For the Text modal, we use the Transformer encoder to extract text features aligned with the audio. We evaluate on the TED-Gesture dataset. Compared with the state-of-art methods, we improve the mean absolute joint error by 2.33%, the mean acceleration difference by 15.01%, and the Frechet gesture distance by 59.32%.",,Session/Server 3,83

We propose a collaborative co-located Mixed Reality (MR) system for training students on radiation safety rules allowing staff to guide the students to practice positioning for radiography safely. The performance of 22 veterinary students was measured before and after they had grouped training sessions using the system. The result showed that the participants performed significantly better in the post-test. This evaluation illustrates the potential of expanding the technique into other subjects.",,Session/Server 3,84

Technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) have been shown to be useful for medical guidance and may contribute to the training of medical experts in these countries. AR has low infrastructure requirements. However, AR is mainly tested for training and surgical applications in highly developed environments. 
In this study, we tested whether AR can also address the needs for healthcare in East Africa. Our study consisted of a medical need-finding part and a pilot study to address some of these needs with AR. Our study shows that remote teaching via AR led to significantly higher test score gains and more consistent results than in the control group.",,Session/Server 3,

Since the COVID pandemic, choirs are moved to videoconferencing systems for rehearsals. However, the limitation of 2D video interfaces restricts the nonverbal communication, spatial awareness, and sense of presence in choral rehearsal. We designed, implemented, and evaluated VRChoir, a VR-based platform for choir rehearsals to improve these pain points. We evaluated VRChoir with conductors and singers with experience rehearsing in a remote environment. Our findings reveal that VR can be a starting point for improving the sense of presence and quality of non-verbal communication in remote music rehearsals.",,Session/Server 3,

When activated, an impermeable boundary encloses the user completely and complicates collaborative tasks, such as passing objects or performing social gestures. When personal space protection is not balanced with functionality, the personal space bubble becomes a gilded cage. In this paper, we raise the possibility of alternate designs for personal space bubbles and test their impact on task performance within a workplace training context. Our early findings suggest that alternate bubble designs have the potential to balance safety and performance metrics such as task completion.",,Session/Server 3,

During planning or execution of the surgery, this digital model is marked by appropriate incision markings through a GUI.
